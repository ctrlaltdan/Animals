# Animals Sample App

The app is built to meet the following requirements.

 - Users have animals
 - Petting animals makes them happy
 - Feeing animals makes them less hungry
 - Animals start "neutral" on both metrics
 - Happiness decreases over time / hunger increases over time
 - Users can own multiple animals of different types
 - Different animal types have metrics which increase/decrease at different rates

## Prerequisites

The application runs in memory with the absense of any data persistance.

The sample code can be exercised by running by both the integration tests and unit tests.
